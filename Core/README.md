# Core — application firmware

`Core/Src/main.c` is CubeMX-generated hardware + FreeRTOS bring-up plus `USER CODE`
that creates the tasks, queues, and the USART1 mutex, and wires peripheral handles.
Each task runs an `<x>_main()` entry, owns a single class, and talks to the rest of
the system **only** through CMSIS-RTOS queues and the shared [[CircularBuffer]] arrays —
never by calling into another task directly.

## main.c conventions
- Timer handles are renamed for clarity: `timestampTimer`, `lumexLcdTimer`, `bpmTimer`.
- Peripheral and queue handles are passed into task entry points; handles also needed
  by ISRs are declared `extern` in the consuming file.
- CubeMX owns everything outside the `USER CODE BEGIN/END` markers — regenerating from
  `stm32_dyno_firmware_v2.ioc` rewrites those regions.
